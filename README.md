## Overview
A game modeled after the Mind Over Measure exhibit at MoMath. The user is prompted to select a number (1-7) at the very beginning, and two tubes of randomized capacity (2-8) will be selected for the user. The goal is to end with the selected number of balls in either of the tubes, making use of the filler, emptier, and transfers between the two tubes.
## Instructions
1. Select an integer (1-7) by typing the according key.
2. Use the following legend to move the balls as you see fit.
    'f' or 'F' : fill
      After typing this key, use the mouse to click the tube you would like to fill. Recall that you can only fill either of the tubes that have been randomly selected for you.
    'e' or 'E' : empty
      After typing this key, use the mouse to click the tube you would like to empty. Recall that you can only empty either of the tubes that have been randomly selected for you.
    't' or 'T' : transfer
      After typing this key, use the mouse to click the tube you would like to transfer from. Recall that you can only transfer between the two tubes that have been randomly selected for you. Thus, there is no need to try and indicate the tube you would like to transfer into.
    's' or 'S' : forfeit
      You will go into forfeit mode. The solution will be shown to you.
    'r' or 'R' : restart
      You will be able to restart the game and you will be given the option to select an integer again.
3. When you reach the goal, you are victorious! Click 'r' or 'R' to start again!
