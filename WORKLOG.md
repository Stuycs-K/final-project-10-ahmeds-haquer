# Work Log

## Sadat Ahmed

### 5/22/23
Started designing the Tube class and added all of the instance variables
### 5/23/23
Wrote the Tube constructors. Altered the fill method, empty method, transfer method, and the necessary helper methods
### 5/24/23
There were errors with the Tube constructor, so I fixed this and tested it on Atom.
### 5/25/23
Solved merge conflicts. Began working on solve on Atom. Finished a first draft, but did not account for possibility of no solution.

## 5/26/23
Finished solve. Added two helper methods, one that finds the GCD of two numbers using Euclid's algorithm and another that checks if there is a solution. For homework from the day before, I did it during a free period and wrote the helper methods. I cleaned it up and finished up the solve code.
